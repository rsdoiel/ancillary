<h1>Basic idea</h1>

<ul>
<li>load assets for a &ldquo;web app&rdquo; UI as a map[string][]byte

<ul>
<li>this allows the assets to the UI to be easily compiled in with the binary application</li>
</ul></li>
<li>create an Ancillary struct using inky.CreateApp(os.Argv, map[string][]byte{}{})

<ul>
<li>We need a minimal amount of metadata to run our application environment, this should be help in the struct returned by CreateApp</li>
</ul></li>
<li>&ldquo;Run&rdquo; the app by invoke Run() on the inky struct

<ul>
<li>takes a handler that maps your app&rsquo;s requests to your applications &ldquo;server side&rdquo; functionality (e.g open files, perform non-UI calculations, etc)</li>
<li>starts a web service on an available port (e.g. using port 8111)</li>
<li>attempts to launch a web browser pointing at the service</li>
<li>provides the applications&rsquo; runtime</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Ancillary ideas</h2>

<ul>
<li>Ancillary package should only provide the binding of web service to web browser launch and maybe a web hook to end the web service, nothing else</li>
<li>Executing the app should reveal the localhost URL and any additional info to manually launch a web browser</li>
<li>We need some way to prevent another user on the system from sniffing the session, probably auto-generate one time passwords and tokens that are resolved on launch of the web browser&rsquo;s initial negotiation with the webpage</li>
<li>If no other web browser instance is running shutting down the web browser should also shutdown the app&rsquo;s web service</li>
</ul>

<h1>Benefits</h1>

<ul>
<li>By relying only on Go&rsquo;s standard library an Ancillary App should be able to be cross compiled to all platforms where Go runs and a web browser is available+ Shipping an Ancillary App is was easy to copying a Go static binary</li>
<li>Ancillary should be reasonable light weight assuming the platform has an optimized web browser</li>
<li>An inky app provides the API &ldquo;server side&rdquo; that the app needs, no other resources get exposed (i.e. no default exposure is provided, no file system access, no process access)</li>
<li>An Ancillary UI is created using standard HTML5, CSS, JavaScript/WebASM that the browser supports so you could limit yourself to HTML5 and create UI that run in Lynx on an embedded system</li>
<li>GopherJS lets you write programming logic and compile to JavaScript today, Go&rsquo;s compiler is expected to compile to WebASM in an upcoming release, in theory an Ancillary App could be written completely in Go</li>
<li>Ancillary App is a Go package and thus could be exposed to other languages as a shared library, e.g. Python, Julia</li>
<li>You can use Go scripting implementations like Lau, JavaScript to provide customization in your app</li>
</ul>
